# This is a test application of Django and Python

I set up a basic API for handling a local application where users can sign up for a newsletter. Their e-mail adress will be safed to the database as well as their name. 
This project was a test application to get used to Django and pipenv.

## Installation
Using pipenv

First download pipenv to be able to set up the project in a virtual environment
